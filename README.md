# SIPENA

This is a complete repository for a website I developed in Yii2 Framework and MySQL Database.

The name SIPENA is short for "Sistem Perekaman Fenomena" or in English is "Phenomena Recording System."

This website is the study case I used for my book "Developing Website with Yii2 Framework", written in Bahasa Indonesia.

# Steps to enjoy:
1. Download everything in the source_code folder. Move the files to your htdocs.
2. Extract sipenademo.zip, this step will also extract sipenademo.z01 and sipenademo.z02
3. Download the sql files in database folder. 
4. Open your Database Server (Localhost, PhpMyAdmin), create a database, name it "sipena."
5. Import sipena.sql to the database you created in step 4.
6. Create another database, name it "sipantas"
7. Import sipantas.sql to the database you created in step 6.
8. If you have a username other than "root" for your database, make changes in database config, in config\db.php and config\dblogin.php
9. Access the website using URL localhost/sipenademo/
